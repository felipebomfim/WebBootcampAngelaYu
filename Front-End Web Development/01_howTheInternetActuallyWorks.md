# How the Internet actually works?

- It is a wire that connects all the computers together.

When I type 'www.google.com':
    - The browser sends my request to a ISP (Internet Service Provider).
    - The ISP sends the request to the DNS (Domain Name System) server. 
    - The DNS server respons with the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the google.com server.
    - Then my host sends the request directly to the google server.
